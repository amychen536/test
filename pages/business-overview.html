            <h2>About Our Business</h2>
            <p>There are several coffee shops within the DMV area, and we will focus on a franchise across the area that does not have a developed rewards or loyalty program for their shop. However, they may already have an app that allows customers to do online orders and view their recent order, as well as an online presence through social media platforms that allows for customers to keep up with any updates. With the current operations further personalization is not yet maximized. This can be done through a blockchain, which is a transparent and safe way to offer, redeem, and track the loyalty points from within the union of coffee shops. It also will provide a convenient way to make purchases and reduce any transaction costs involved, as well as showing customers appreciation.</p>
            <p>For the success of a blockchain implementation, it is important to communicate and keep people engaged through social media and the websites of the shops, and to be transparent about what the blockchain will offer. Through the several social media platforms, shops can receive feedback and suggestions from customers to help the blockchain be developed that is easy to use and incentivize customers to maintain their loyalty, as well as attract more customers. As more and more people join the blockchain, more data will be collected to analyze what products are most popular and what products should be added to the menu.</p>
