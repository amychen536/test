    <h1>DMV Coffee Shop Business Strategy</h1>
    <p>1. The LoyalTerp committed to helping chain coffee shops that do not have blockchain technology build their own
        blockchain and reward tokens to increase sales and brand value.</p>
    <p>2. The top-level objective is increasing sales by 20% in the next three years.</p>
    <p>3. Since blockchain technology has not been widely used, use differentiation to attract new customers and
        retain customers by distributing reward tokens that do not expire.</p>
    <p>4. Using blockchain technology to attract young customers, who are more willing to try new technologies and
        will be the main force in future market consumption.</p>
    <p>5. One core principle of blockchain technology is irreversibility of records. It prevents insider fraud.
        And, it is convenient for the owner to view sales records and control internal management.</p>
    <p>6. Every purchase is  greater than 10 dollars, get 1 token. Every purchase is  greater than 30 dollars, and gets
        1.1  tokens. Set a promotion day when customers would earn double the amount of token.</p>
    <p>7. Earned tokens could exchange coffee products or transfer to other customers.</p>
